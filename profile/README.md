## 🔧 What We're Building

### **🧠 PineScript Engine for JS/TS/Node.js**
A full PineScript-style execution engine, allowing you to run indicator and strategy logic in JavaScript and TypeScript with native time-series behavior.

Built around our flagship project:

➡️ **PineTS** — https://github.com/QuantForgeOrg/PineTS

---

📊 Financial Visualization (QFChart)
Our dedicated charting system. It bridges the gap between raw data and visual insights, specifically tuned for the outputs of the PineTS engine but can be used to visualize any financial data/indicators .

Optimized for Quants: Built for real-time market data, technical overlays, and strategy backtest results.

Seamless Integration: Native support for visualizing PineTS indicator series.
