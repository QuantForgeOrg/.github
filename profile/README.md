# 🌐 QuantForge.org (QFO)

**QuantForge.org** is an open-source initiative focused on building modern, high-performance tools for quantitative trading and market analysis.

We aim to provide a clean, modular ecosystem for developers, traders, and researchers working with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js.

## 🔧 What We're Building

### **🧠 PineScript Engine for JS/TS/Node.js**
A full PineScript-style execution engine, allowing you to run indicator and strategy logic in JavaScript and TypeScript with native time-series behavior.

Built around our flagship project:

➡️ **PineTS** - https://github.com/QuantForgeOrg/PineTS

➡️ **PineTS Discussions** - https://github.com/QuantForgeOrg/PineTS/discussions

---

📊 Financial Visualization (QFChart)
Our dedicated charting system. It bridges the gap between raw data and visual insights, specifically tuned for the outputs of the PineTS engine but can be used to visualize any financial data/indicators .

Optimized for Quants: Built for real-time market data, technical overlays, and strategy backtest results.

Seamless Integration: Native support for visualizing PineTS indicator series.

## 🧪 Try the QuantForge Playground

QuantForge isn’t just a set of libraries and runtimes, you can **try the core engine instantly in your browser with the Playground**.

The Playground is an interactive environment powered by the **PineTS execution engine** and the **QFChart visualization library** that lets you:

- Write and execute Pine Script™ code live in your browser  
- Visualize indicators with real charting  
- Experiment with logic and parameters with **zero setup or installation**  
- Prototype ideas before embedding them into your apps

It’s the fastest way to test scripts, explore indicator behavior, and iterate on quant logic without leaving your browser.

Whether you’re learning Pine Script, verifying a strategy, or building dashboards, the Playground accelerates development and lowers the barrier to entry for experimenting with PineTS and QFChart.

### **🛰️ Indicator Server**
A dedicated backend for:
- computing indicators,
- serving processed time-series data,
- powering dashboards, algorithmic systems, or external apps.
